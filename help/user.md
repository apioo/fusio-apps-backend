## User

A user is either a `Consumer` of your API or an internal user which can
configure and develop your API. You can assign every user to a specific role,
which assigns specific scopes to the user. Those scopes give the user the rights
to access specific endpoints of your API. At the settings you can set the
default role which every user gets assigned if he registers i.e. at the
developer app.
